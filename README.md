<h1>LED and Pushbutton on RPi</h1>

The <code>pushbutton-led.py</code> file contains two methods:

- <code>led()</code> to toggle an LED once, connected to GPIO pin 18 on the Raspberry Pi
- <code>pushbutton()</code> to use a push button connected to GPIO pin 17 to light an LED.
	- Manually end the program after use.
